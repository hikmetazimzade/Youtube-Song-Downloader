## Overview
This project is a web automation tool designed to streamline the process of downloading songs. Users can list the names of the songs they want to download in a file named `song_names.txt` within the `songs` directory. The automation then searches for the URLs of these songs and downloads them to a specified path.

## Features
- **Song Listing**: Users can easily list songs they wish to download.
- **Automated Downloading**: The tool automatically finds and downloads the songs.
- **Custom Download Path**: Users can specify the download location for ease of access.

## How It Works
1. **List Songs**: Write down the names of the songs you want to download in `song_names.txt` located in the `songs` directory.
2. **Run Automation**: Execute the automation script. It will read the song names, search for their URLs, and start the download process.
3. **Download**: The songs will be downloaded to the chosen path. Ensure you have sufficient permissions for the chosen directory.
